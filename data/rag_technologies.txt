Technologies commonly used in RAG systems include:

1. LangChain – An open-source Python framework designed for building applications powered by language models. It helps link retrieval, generation, and prompt management.
2. FAISS – A library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, developed by Facebook AI Research.
3. HuggingFace Transformers – A library providing thousands of pre-trained NLP models, including BERT, GPT-2, T5, and others.
4. Sentence Transformers – A Python library that makes it easy to compute vector embeddings for text, allowing semantic search.

Fun Fact:
FAISS is written mainly in C++ but has Python bindings, making it fast and easy to integrate into ML pipelines.
