Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI method that combines information retrieval with text generation.  
The goal is to enhance a language model's ability to provide accurate and relevant answers by supplying it with additional, context-rich information.  

Key Steps in a RAG Pipeline:
1. Retrieve relevant documents from a database or knowledge base.
2. Pass the retrieved documents to a generation model.
3. Produce a context-aware answer.

Benefits of RAG:
- Reduces hallucinations by grounding answers in actual data.
- Can use smaller models while still giving high-quality results.
- Allows easy updates to knowledge without retraining the model.
